Howdy gpt, hope you are well. This is a bit of a project in its speculative phase where we decide if it's in fact worth chasing down and pursuing. 

Basically if you look under ~/pkgs/src I've got a script that a scientist put out for color review and analysis. They provided an online notebook where it can be used but it's not very usable in how it's formatted. 

The actual performance at least on the notbook is quite poor. 

the goal is to basically review if we can port this to a local electron app where we control a bit more of the front end and make a comfy and usable interface. 

as a bit of a pie in the sky goal the current implementation is in some "observable" runtime. I suspect this fact is not disconnected from our poor performance. It's worth asking if we can move some of this backend to be more like a contained wasm running at rust speeds but if its not a managable lift thats understandable. 

the ~/git/color-abstract-via-multidim-KMeans/pkgs/proportions-et-relations-colorees/ directory is a project we worked on porting an older site by the same scientist before i just found this one existed. It has 3d functions we do not need to recover or save. The place it's stronger is the bar on the side listing the most common colors with id's + the ability to export a .csv of all tracked colors. 

The main advantage of the newer script is much more robust controls for the 2d graphs. 

you can see you have a figma mcp. I've designed a full application ui. Lets look over this code and the ui concept and review if this is in fact a feasible project.
