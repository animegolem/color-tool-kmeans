# AI-IMP-014-rust-kmeans-core

## Summary of Issue #1
We need a high‑performance k‑means implementation for 3‑dim vectors with k‑means++ init, warm‑starts, and optional mini‑batch. Outcome: function `kmeans_3d(points: &[[f32;3]], k: usize, cfg) -> {centroids, counts, iterations}` parallelized with rayon and deterministic seeding.

### Out of Scope 
- IPC glue; chart/palette rendering; CSV.

### Design/Approach  
- Start with a simple SoA layout for points and centroids; implement k‑means++ seeding and iterative assignment/update with early exit by centroid shift `tol`.
- Use `rayon` for assignment and centroid reductions. Support warm‑starts by accepting initial centroids.
- Add mini‑batch mode for very large sample sets.

### Files to Touch
- `src-tauri/crates/core/src/kmeans.rs`.
- `src-tauri/crates/core/tests/kmeans.rs`.

### Implementation Checklist

<CRITICAL_RULE>
Before marking an item complete on the checklist MUST **stop** and **think**. Have you validated all aspects are **implemented** and **tested**? 
</CRITICAL_RULE> 

- [ ] Implement k‑means++ init with seeded RNG.
- [ ] Implement iterative assign/update with early stop by `tol` or `max_iter`.
- [ ] Add warm‑start support.
- [ ] Add mini‑batch option behind a flag.
- [ ] Unit tests: synthetic clustered datasets converge, counts near ground truth.
- [ ] Benchmarks on 100k samples @ K=300; record timings.

### Acceptance Criteria
**Scenario: Convergence and timing**
GIVEN synthetic 3‑cluster data
WHEN running k=3 with default cfg
THEN algorithm converges ≤20 iterations and returns non‑zero counts; benchmark shows ≥5× speedup vs JS baseline on similar hardware (informational).

### Issues Encountered 
To be filled during implementation.
