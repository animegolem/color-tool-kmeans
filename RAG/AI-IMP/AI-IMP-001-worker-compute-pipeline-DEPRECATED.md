# AI-IMP-001-worker-compute-pipeline

## Summary of Issue #1
Current compute happens in an Observable runtime causing >60 s updates and UI jank. We need a local, reusable compute pipeline that decodes images, samples pixels, converts color spaces, and runs k‑means (K≤400) entirely off the main thread. Intended remediation: a Web Worker using typed arrays, warm‑start centroids, and adaptive sampling to hit ≤150 ms P50 recompute on typical images. Done state: worker API implemented with deterministic outputs across OS and validated timings on sample images.

### Out of Scope 
- UI rendering (charts), exports, and Electron shell wiring.
- Rust/WASM implementation (tracked separately; ensure contract allows swap).

### Design/Approach  
- Create `color-worker` running in its own thread. Message types:
  - `compute`: { id, pixels, width, height, stride, minLum, space, K, maxIter, tol, seed, warmStartCentroids? }
  - `cancel`: { id }
  - `ping` for health.
- Image sampling in renderer: draw to `OffscreenCanvas`, get `ImageData`, downsample by stride; pass an `Uint8ClampedArray` or transfer an `ArrayBuffer` to worker.
- Color spaces: implement pure JS/TS functions for RGB↔HSL, RGB↔YUV (BT.601), RGB↔CIELAB (D65, sRGB gamma), RGB↔CIELUV (u′v′). Use float32 math; emit both working space triplets and canonical RGB for display.
- K‑means: k‑means++ init; loop until centroid delta < `tol` or `maxIter`. Use `Float32Array` for centroids and points; index arrays for membership; reduce using SIMD‑friendly loops. Optionally mini‑batch if points>200k.
- Warm‑starts: if only parameters like stride/minLum/space change, reuse previous centroids when compatible.
- Output: clusters array with centroid triplets (per selected space), computed RGB, pixel counts, and share; also provide elapsed ms and iterations.

### Files to Touch
- `electron-app/src/worker/color-worker.ts`: implement worker entry (build target JS).
- `electron-app/src/worker/colorspaces.ts`: color conversions.
- `electron-app/src/worker/kmeans.ts`: typed‑array k‑means (k‑means++ + loop).
- `electron-app/src/shared/messages.ts`: worker message/response types.
- `electron-app/src/renderer/pipeline.ts`: sampling + worker orchestration.
- `electron-app/tsconfig.json`, `package.json`: build config for workers.

### Implementation Checklist

<CRITICAL_RULE>
Before marking an item complete on the checklist MUST **stop** and **think**. Have you validated all aspects are **implemented** and **tested**? 
</CRITICAL_RULE> 

- [x] Create `messages.ts` with `ComputeRequest`, `ComputeResult`, error and cancel contracts.
- [x] Implement `colorspaces.ts` with RGB↔HSL, RGB↔YUV (BT.601), XYZ, LAB (D65), LUV; add unit tests for round-trips where applicable.
- [x] Implement `kmeans.ts` with k-means++ init, convergence by centroid delta, `maxIter`, `tol`, and cancellation hooks.
- [x] Implement `color-worker.ts` to parse messages, run conversions + k-means, and post transferable results (buffers) with timings.
- [x] Implement `pipeline.ts` to sample buffers, apply stride/minLum/maxSamples, and issue worker requests.
- [x] Add warm-start support: cache centroids by key (space,K,stride,minLum) and reuse when compatible.
- [x] Add cancellation token per compute id; ignore late results after new request.
- [x] Smoke test with K=10/100/300 on 12–24 MP images; record P50/P95 times.
- [x] Validate deterministic results given same seed via unit test.
- [x] Document API and performance notes in `README-dev.md`.

### Acceptance Criteria
**Scenario: Compute clusters on a typical image**
GIVEN a 12–24 MP PNG/JPEG is loaded and stride is set to 4
WHEN the user sets K=300 and toggles HSL
THEN the worker returns clusters with counts and RGB within ≤150 ms P50 on reference hardware
AND the UI remains responsive during computation
AND subsequent slider changes reuse warm‑starts, reducing time by ≥25%.

**Scenario: Cancel in‑flight computation**
GIVEN a compute request is running
WHEN the user changes K
THEN the previous compute is canceled and does not update the UI
AND only the latest result is applied.

### Issues Encountered 
- Synthetic 12 MP smoke test with stride 2 still exceeds 150 ms target (K=300 ≈ 2.4 s). Documented in `README-dev.md`; further optimization scheduled for AI-IMP-009 (mini-batch/SIMD).
