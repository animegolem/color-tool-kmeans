# 2025-10-07-LOG-AI-epic5-bridges-tauri-native-and-home-decode

## Work Completed
- Advanced Epic‑005 across IMP‑051 (shell‑agnostic bridges) and IMP‑052 (Home view baseline). Implemented `computeBridge`/`fsBridge` with adapters for Electron, browser/wasm, and new Tauri‑native paths.
- Added Zod validation at bridge boundaries (Electron/IPC) and strengthened type mapping to the renderer’s JSON contract.
- Integrated native Tauri commands:
  - Rust: `analyze_image(req)` already present; added `open_image_dialog()` for native file pick.
  - JS: added tauri adapter selection plus a resilient `tauriInvoke()` (prefers `window.__TAURI__.*.invoke`, falls back to `@tauri-apps/api`).
- Home view now solely talks to bridges; drag/drop and upload use `fsBridge`. Parameters debounce and spinner threshold are wired; logging gated to `DEV`.
- Resolved Svelte 5 slot/runes issues causing runtime `$.get` crashes by inlining overlays and then converting components to snippet‑based patterns; left overlays inline for stability during smoke tests.
- Hardened browser decode path with ImageBitmap→HTMLImage fallback plus logging; added a localStorage override `imageLoader.forceHtmlImage` for diagnostics.

## Session Commits
- Bridge work: `tauri-app/src/lib/bridges/{compute,fs}.ts` and new `bridges/tauri.ts` for robust Tauri detection/invocation.
- Home baseline: `tauri-app/src/lib/views/HomeView.svelte` (bridge integration, drag overlay debounce, keyboard/focus tweaks).
- Decode hardening: `tauri-app/src/lib/compute/image-loader.ts` fallback and logs.
- Tauri native wiring: `tauri-app/src-tauri/src/main.rs` added `open_image_dialog` using callback API; adjusted invoke signatures.
- Electron parity: preload/main support for open/save and compute IPC (kept for reference).
- Template/tickets: updated IMP‑051/052 checklists to reflect bridge abstraction completion and Home keyboard support.

## Issues Encountered
- Svelte 5 slot migration: custom overlay component triggered `$.get` runtime errors in Flatpak browsers; resolved by inlining overlays and later moving to snippet props. Kept inline for this smoke phase to reduce moving parts.
- Browser image decode under Flatpak (Firefox/Vivaldi) returned zero‑dimension images; fallback to `<img>` path did not change outcome in container. Logs added; root cause likely environment/codec sandboxing.
- Tauri JS API resolution: dynamic import of `@tauri-apps/api` failed to resolve in the WebView on the container; detection now prefers `window.__TAURI__.*.invoke` before falling back. Despite patches, the running bundle still selected wasm/browser adapters on the reporter’s machine, indicating the WebView was serving a browser bundle (likely due to Vite reuse) or globals not injected.
- Port conflicts: Tauri’s `beforeDevCommand` launches Vite; parallel `npm run dev` caused Vite to bind 5175 first, serving a non‑Tauri bundle. Documented single‑entry dev flow.

## Tests Added
- No unit tests added. Validation via `svelte-check` across renderer, manual smoke runs for drag/upload, and targeted console logging for bridge selection and decode path.

## Next Steps
- Environment sanity check outside container: pull these changes on a non‑Flatpak host and run `npm run tauri dev` only. Expect bridges to select `tauri-native`/`tauri` and analysis to populate metrics.
- If still falling back to wasm/browser, add a startup banner that prints `typeof window.__TAURI__`, the active adapter ids, and the Vite dev server URL to confirm the served bundle.
- Optionally wire a Tauri native drop handler so file drops provide a path (skipping browser Blob decode entirely in native runs).
- After decode/compute confirmed in native: close out IMP‑052 smoke items (spinner/metrics), then proceed to IMP‑053 (Graphs polish) and IMP‑054 (Exports integration) under bridges.
- Revisit overlay componentization once stability is confirmed; restore snippet‑based component with Svelte 5‑compatible API.
