# 2025-09-29-LOG-AI-epic5-ui-bridges-ci-and-wasm-bench

## Work Completed
1) Electron shell stabilized and upgraded: bumped Electron to 33.x, added retry on renderer load, fixed preload path to `.mjs`, enabled Svelte 5 runes with compatibility, and resolved initial blank-window cases.
2) Wasm compute module integrated for the renderer: added crate + wrapper earlier, then added a wasm bench runner to compare against native results. Output saved to `bench-reports/wasm-bench.json`.
3) Exports implemented on Chromium: wired circle graph PNG/SVG and palette CSV with save via Electron preload or browser fallback; added helpers under `src/lib/exports/*`.
4) CI & packaging: added GitHub Actions workflow to build Electron artifacts (Linux AppImage, Windows portable) and upload artifacts + checksums.
5) New Epic‑005 created for shell‑agnostic UI integration; filed IMP‑051..057 to track bridges, Home/Graphs polish, exports integration, preferences, a11y, and CI renderer checks.

## Session Commits
- Electron scaffold + config: updated `electron.vite.config.ts`, `src/main/index.ts`, and `src/preload/index.ts` to support runes and reliable dev startup; added logging hooks.
- Renderer updates: adjusted Svelte 5 mount patterns, fixed placeholder, and added Exports UI wiring.
- Wasm bench: added `scripts/bench/wasm-bench.mjs`; documented usage in `bench-reports/README.md`.
- CI: introduced `.github/workflows/electron-build.yml`; tweaked root/package scripts to support checks.

## Issues Encountered
- Initial Electron dev window blank: caused by preload extension mismatch and Svelte 5 API differences. Fixed by switching to `.mjs`, enabling runes, compatibility mode, and a reload on `did-fail-load`.
- Wayland/NVIDIA concerns: current Electron 33 path loads consistently; occasional first-load timing was mitigated with retry and delayed DevTools.
- Wasm performance: scalar, single‑thread wasm is much slower than native (seconds vs sub‑second). Parity is good; we’ll use capped previews and keep native for heavy runs while exploring wasm threads/SIMD as a follow‑up.

## Tests Added
- Vitest: CSV determinism (`src/lib/exports/__tests__/palette.spec.ts`).
- Wasm bench: console + JSON comparison versus native runs, exercising module load and dataset conversion.

## Next Steps
- Start Epic‑005 with IMP‑051 (compute/fs bridges) to fully decouple views from host specifics.
- Finish Home view finalization (IMP‑052) and Graphs polish (IMP‑053), then confirm exports (IMP‑054) across Electron/browser.
- Optional: prototype wasm threads/SIMD to narrow the wasm/native gap; retain native route for heavy jobs if needed.
