# 2025-09-22-LOG-AI-rust-ui-perf

## Work Completed
Implemented the Rust color-space module (sRGBâ†”linear, XYZ, LAB, LUV, YUV, HSL/HSV) with unit tests, parallelized the k-means core using rayon (warm-start + mini-batch support) and captured release timings (~5.9 s at K=300 on 120k synthetic samples). Locked the 2025-09-22 Figma snapshot manifest after adding new overlays, refreshed Home view overlays/token styling, and opened AI-EPIC-003 plus URGENT benchmark harness ticket (AI-IMP-031) for JS vs Rust comparisons on the four bench images.

## Session Commits
Local changes only; no commits were pushed. Work spans color/kmeans modules, Home overlay styling, benchmark runner, and planning docs.

## Issues Encountered
Parallel k-means still trails the historical JS timing (~2.6 s). Likely driven by heavier synthetic dataset, no warm-start reuse, and lack of SIMD. Documented in IMP-014 for follow-up. Initial attempt to add Criterion benchmarks failed due to network restrictions; replaced with a simple release-mode runner.

## Tests Added
Added unit tests covering LAB/LUV/YUV/HSL/HSV round-trips plus k-means convergence (parallel path, warm start, mini-batch). `cargo test` runs clean in tauri-app/src-tauri.

## Next Steps
- Execute AI-IMP-031 harness to gather JS vs Rust metrics on the real benchmark images and archive results in bench-reports/.
- Profile k-means with actual sample counts; explore warm-start persistence and `kmeans_colors` adoption if needed.
- Wire UI spinner thresholds to measured timings and schedule additional optimization tickets if Rust remains above target.
