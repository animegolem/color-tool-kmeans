# 2025-09-21-LOG-AI-tauri-pivot

## Work Completed
- Added project-wide quality gates (IMP-010): pre-commit hook invoking workspace format/lint checks plus a 350 LOC warning, LOC enforcement in CI with bypass token, and documentation updates for hook setup.
- Scaffolded the new Tauri + Svelte application shell (IMP-011): manual Vite/Svelte setup, navigation for Home/Graphs/Exports, drag-and-drop and File→Open plumbing, parameter controls matching Figma, local Fira Sans font assets, and helper README.
- Implemented the Rust image sampling pipeline (IMP-012): decode PNG/JPEG/WebP, optional resize, stride-based sampling with BT.709 luminance filter, deterministic reservoir sampling, metadata in `SampleResult`, unit tests with temporary PNG fixtures, wired into the Tauri command, and verified tests on Fedora with WebKitGTK 4.1.

## Session Commits
- `docs: refresh figma exports and agent guidance` — captured latest design frames and updated agent instructions.
- `docs: add first 5 IMPs for Tauri+Rust pivot` — documented new implementation tickets (IMP-011 through IMP-015).
- `chore(ci): add CI workflow, pre-commit hooks, and LOC policy (350 LOC with bypass)` — introduced hooks, CI workflow, LOC scripts, and AGENTS guidance.
- `feat(tauri): scaffold Svelte UI with navigation, params, and font setup` — added the new `tauri-app` workspace, Svelte views, stores, fonts, and Tauri boilerplate.
- `feat(rust): add image sampling pipeline with stride, luma filter, and reservoir` (amended) — created sampling module, upgraded to Tauri 2 plugins, added placeholder icon, updated config and dependencies.

## Issues Encountered
- Fed server initially blocked crate downloads; resolved by running `cargo fetch` once network was available.
- WebKitGTK 4.0 deprecation on Fedora triggered pkg-config errors. Added instructions to install `webkit2gtk4.1-devel` and set `TAURI_USE_WEBKIT2GTK_4_1=1` before Cargo commands.
- Tauri 2.x schema changes (`devUrl`, `frontendDist`) required updating `tauri.conf.json`; missing icon PNG caused proc macro panic until a valid 1×1 RGBA asset was generated.
- `fast_image_resize` API introduced unnecessary complexity without network; switched to `image::resize` to keep dependencies minimal.

## Tests Added
- `tauri-app/src-tauri/src/image_pipeline.rs` unit tests covering stride/luma filtering, reservoir cap, and downscale dimension bounds. Successful on Fedora once dependencies cached.
- CI pipeline now runs existing Node tests (if electron workspace remains) and Rust fmt/clippy/test conditionally, ensuring future coverage for sampling.

## Next Steps
- Implement IMP-013 (Rust color-space conversions) to provide HSL/YUV/LAB/LUV transforms atop the new sampler.
- Add benchmark harness (Criterion or manual timing) comparing Rust sampling + future k-means to the previous ~2.4 s JS baseline using representative 12–24 MP images.
- Build out the Rust k-means core (IMP-014) and IPC contract (IMP-015), then integrate the Svelte charts with real data.
- Once benchmarks run, document performance results and adjust sampling defaults (stride/max dimension) to meet the ≤150 ms target.
