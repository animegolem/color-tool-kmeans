# 2025-09-25-LOG-AI-svelte5-upgrade

## Work Completed
- Upgraded the renderer toolchain to Svelte 5 by updating dependencies (Svelte, eslint/prettier plugins, svelte-check) and refreshing the README/conventions to highlight runes usage.
- Migrated `App.svelte`, `HomeView.svelte`, `GraphsView.svelte`, `ExportsView.svelte`, and `FadeOverlay.svelte` to runes patterns (`$state`, `$derived`, `$effect`, `$props`) and swapped legacy `on:` handlers for `onclick`/`ondragover` equivalents.
- Added derived store bridges in views to replace `$store` syntax while preserving global state wiring (selected file, params, analysis results).
- Implemented preview UX refinements while upgrading: spinner threshold now keyed off runes state, error overlays reuse the new stores, and cluster preview renders via derived data.
- Introduced lint/CI guardrails: pre-commit hook and GitHub Actions now fail on `on:` DOM event usage, ensuring future patches stick to runes conventions.
- Updated `contracts/global-conventions.md` and `tauri-app/README.md` with the enforced runes policy so the team has a single source of truth.

## Session Commits
- `ef37238` – invoke `analyze_image` IPC with runes-compliant preview; closed IMP-025.
- _pending_ – Svelte 5 upgrade commits staged in this session (package.json, runes rewrites, tooling guards). Note: `npm install` could not complete due to sandbox DNS; manifests are updated for follow-up install.

## Issues Encountered
- `npm install`/`npm run build`/`npm run dev` failed (`EAI_AGAIN`) because the sandbox cannot reach npm registry. Lockfile still references Svelte 4 until install runs on a connected host. After pulling: `cd tauri-app && npm install && npm run build`.
- Because the install step was blocked, runtime validation of the new Svelte 5 bundles isn’t captured; expect to rerun lint/check/dev scripts locally once the lockfile refreshes.

## Tests Added
- None (tooling change). Manual verification pending a networked environment.

## Next Steps
- On a connected machine, run `npm install`, `npm run build`, and `npm run dev` inside `tauri-app` to hydrate the new dependencies and ensure the upgraded runes components compile.
- Update `package-lock.json` with the resolved Svelte 5 tree; commit the refreshed lockfile to remove the remaining npm audit warnings.
- Consider adding a lightweight Vitest store test to cover the new `analysisState` transitions once the lockfile is refreshed.
