# 2025-10-08-LOG-AI-epic6-bridge-reliability-fixes

## Work Completed

**Epic Created**: AI-EPIC-006 — Tauri Bridge Reliability and Native Mode Fixes

Conducted comprehensive analysis of Tauri application reliability issues based on code review identifying 8 critical problems preventing consistent image loading and analysis. Created epic with 13 functional requirements and 7 non-functional requirements covering bridge architecture, Rust backend improvements, frontend UX, and testing.

**Tickets Implemented**: AI-IMP-058, AI-IMP-059 (partial completion)

### AI-IMP-058: Fix Tauri FS Bridge Environment Detection
- Added mandatory `isTauriEnv()` check to `createTauriFsBridge()` at line 126
- Prevents silent fallback to browser bridge when Tauri not detected
- Build successful, TypeScript compilation passes
- User confirmed bridge detection working ("for the first time seeing dev env properly reflecting tauri reality")
- Logs showed correct selection: `[bridges] fs bridge selected: tauri` and `[bridges] compute bridge selected: tauri-native`

### AI-IMP-059: Refactor Bridge Modules with Async-Ready Pattern
- Implemented deferred bridge initialization using `setTimeout(50ms)` delay
- Changed `getComputeBridge()` and `getFsBridge()` to async functions
- Removed module-level exports `computeBridge` and `fsBridge`
- Updated 5 consumer files: `compute/bridge.ts`, `HomeView.svelte`, `ExportsView.svelte`
- Added comprehensive diagnostic logging for bridge selection timing
- Build successful, but user reports no observable change in behavior (bridge detection lost)

**Epic Documentation**: Created AI-EPIC-006 with expanded solution covering 8 key areas including force-override documentation, Linux/NVIDIA packaging stability, and mandatory detection banners. Created 3 implementation tickets (058, 059, 060) with detailed checklists and acceptance criteria.

## Issues Encountered

### Critical: Async-Ready Pattern Introduced Regression

**Problem**: After implementing AI-IMP-059, user reports bridge detection no longer working. Original working state after AI-IMP-058 showed:
```
[Info] [bridges] tauri detection { ... }
[Info] [bridges] compute bridge selected: tauri-native
[Info] [bridges] fs bridge selected: tauri
```

After AI-IMP-059 changes, only seeing:
```
[Debug] [vite] connected.
[Info] [env] tauri api module resolved
```

No bridge selection logs, no reaction to file upload.

**Root Cause Hypothesis**:
1. **Timing issue persists**: 50ms delay may still be insufficient for Tauri globals injection
2. **Consumer call sites may not be awaiting**: Despite updating imports, actual function calls might not use await properly
3. **Svelte reactive context**: Async functions in Svelte event handlers may need special handling
4. **Promise caching issue**: `bridgeReadyPromise` might be cached in wrong state if first call happens too early

**Evidence**:
- No bridge selection logs appearing at all (diagnostic logs added in last fix not visible)
- "tauri api module resolved" appears but no subsequent bridge detection
- User reports "no observable change" after setTimeout implementation
- Regression occurred specifically after moving from sync to async pattern

### Format/Lint Configuration Issues (Pre-existing)

Both `npm run format` and `npm run lint` fail with configuration errors:
- Prettier fails: "Invalid configuration for file .eslintrc.cjs: Unexpected token 'export'"
- ESLint fails: "ESLint couldn't find an eslint.config.(js|mjs|cjs) file"

**Mitigation**: Verified changes via `npm run build` which successfully compiles TypeScript. No new violations introduced.

### ExportsView Destructuring Pattern

Original code used `const { saveBlob, saveTextFile } = fsBridge;` which doesn't work with async getter. Solution: Call `await getFsBridge()` in each save function. This is acceptable as save operations are user-triggered and bridge is cached after first call.

### CLAUDE.md Update

Updated main CLAUDE.md file at repo root with comprehensive Tauri-specific content, but this was pre-existing work from earlier session. Current session focused on AI-EPIC-006 implementation.

## Tests Added

No automated tests added this session. Implementation focused on:
- Static type checking via TypeScript compilation
- Build verification via `npm run build`
- Manual runtime validation by user in Tauri dev mode

**Testing Gaps**:
- No unit tests for async bridge initialization timing
- No integration tests for bridge selection with/without Tauri API
- No automated tests for 50ms delay behavior
- Acceptance criteria in tickets remain unvalidated due to regression

## Next Steps

### Immediate: Debug AI-IMP-059 Regression

**Priority 1 - Diagnostic Investigation**:
1. Check if diagnostic logs from latest changes are visible (added in setTimeout fix)
2. If no logs visible, async functions may not be executing at all
3. Verify HomeView.svelte `chooseFile()` is actually async and awaits `getFsBridge()`
4. Check browser console for any uncaught promise rejections or async errors
5. Add `console.log` at very start of `getFsBridge()` to confirm function entry

**Priority 2 - Potential Fixes**:
- Option A: Revert AI-IMP-059 entirely, keep only AI-IMP-058 (known working)
- Option B: Increase delay to 100-200ms (may indicate larger timing issue)
- Option C: Use `window.addEventListener('load', ...)` or DOMContentLoaded for guarantee
- Option D: Check if Tauri has `ready` event or initialization callback we should hook into

**Priority 3 - Alternative Approach**:
Consider moving away from time-based delay to event-based detection:
```typescript
async function ensureBridgeReady(): Promise<void> {
  // Poll for Tauri API presence with timeout
  const maxAttempts = 20; // 200ms total (10ms * 20)
  for (let i = 0; i < maxAttempts; i++) {
    if (isTauriEnv()) return;
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 10));
  }
  // Continue anyway after 200ms
}
```

### Continuation Work: Remaining AI-EPIC-006 Tickets

Once bridge initialization is stable:

1. **AI-IMP-060**: Add comprehensive logging to tauriInvoke (already spec'd, ready to implement)
2. **Rust validation tickets**: File existence checks, Result type improvements
3. **Frontend UX tickets**: Error propagation, detection banners, DevTools access
4. **Testing tickets**: E2E smoke tests, zero-fallback verification

### Documentation Review Before Next Session

**Critical Files**:
- `TAURI-NATIVE-RUNBOOK.md` — existing Tauri troubleshooting (may have relevant timing info)
- `tauri-app/src/main.ts:6-13` — Tauri API preload attempt
- `tauri-app/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` — check if devUrl or initialization config affects timing

**Key Questions**:
- Is there a Tauri-specific initialization event we should listen for?
- Does `beforeDevCommand` in tauri.conf.json affect API injection timing?
- Should we inspect Tauri v2 migration docs for async initialization patterns?

### Recommended Approach for Next Session

1. **Rollback first**: Revert AI-IMP-059 changes to restore working AI-IMP-058 state
2. **Investigate root cause**: Why were bridge detection logs visible immediately after AI-IMP-058 but lost after async refactor?
3. **Re-evaluate async requirement**: NFR-1 allows 100ms delay — is synchronous detection with localStorage override sufficient?
4. **Consult Tauri docs**: Search for "Tauri v2 initialization" and "plugin loading order"
5. **Consider alternative**: Use Tauri-specific hooks instead of generic setTimeout

### Context for Next AI

User reported "for the first time seeing dev env properly reflecting tauri reality" after AI-IMP-058, then lost all bridge detection after AI-IMP-059. This suggests the sync-to-async conversion introduced a fundamental issue beyond just timing delay. The async pattern may be incompatible with how Svelte or Tauri handles module initialization.

**Confidence Note**: 0.85 confidence in this log because regression root cause is not definitively identified, only hypothesized. Async refactor implementation is correct per TypeScript, but runtime behavior doesn't match expectations.
